Q-Learning is a powerful model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function directly without requiring a model of the environment.

## Understanding Model-Based vs. Model-Free Approaches

### Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

A model of the environment in reinforcement learning refers to explicit knowledge of the system dynamics, specifically:

- **State Transition Probabilities**: $p_{ij}(u)$ - The probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ when taking action $u$
- **Reward/Cost Functions**: $g(i,u,j)$ - The immediate reward or cost received when transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ via action $u$

With a complete model, we can use dynamic programming methods like value iteration or policy iteration to compute optimal policies without direct environment interaction.

### Model-Free Reinforcement Learning

In contrast, model-free methods like Q-Learning operate without requiring explicit knowledge of transition probabilities or reward functions. These approaches:

- Learn directly from interactions with the environment
- Update value estimates based on experienced transitions and rewards
- Do not attempt to build an internal model of how the environment works

Model-free methods excel when:

- Environment dynamics are unknown or difficult to model
- The state space is large, making explicit modeling computationally intractable
- The environment is non-stationary (changing over time)

Q-Learning exemplifies this model-free approach by learning optimal action values through direct experience, without needing to know how the environment will respond to actions beforehand.

## SMDP Setting

In the context of Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPP), let's recall the Bellman equation:

<div class="math">
$$
J^*(i) = \min_{u \in A(i)} \sum_{j \in S} p_{ij}(u) \left( g(i,u,j) + J^*(j) \right) \tag{1}
$$
</div>
where:

- $J^*(i)$ is the optimal cost-to-go from state $i$
- $A(i)$ is the set of actions available in state $i$
- $p_{ij}(u)$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ when taking action $u$
- $g(i,u,j)$ is the immediate cost when transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ via action $u$

Note that this formulation can also accommodate discount factors for infinite horizon problems.

## The Q-Function Definition

Let's define the optimal Q-function (action-value function) as:

<div class="math">
$$
Q^*(i,u) = \sum_{j \in S} p_{ij}(u) \left( g(i,u,j) + J^*(j) \right) \tag{2}
$$
</div>

This represents the expected total cost when taking action $u$ in state $i$ and following the optimal policy thereafter.

From $(1)$ and $(2)$, we have:

<div class="math">
$$
J^*(i) = \min_{u \in A(i)} Q^*(i,u) \tag{3}
$$
</div>

Note that $Q$ is a function of both the state and action, whereas $J$ is a function of only the state. This additional action dimension in the Q-function allows us to evaluate the quality of specific actions in each state without requiring a model of the environment.

## The Q-Bellman Equation

The Q-function satisfies its own Bellman equation (also called the Q-Bellman equation):

<div class="math">
$$
Q^*(i,u) = \sum_{j=1}^n p_{ij}(u) \left( g(i,u,j) + \min_{v \in A(j)} Q^*(j,v) \right) \tag{4}
$$
</div>

This recursive relationship forms the foundation of Q-learning, allowing us to learn optimal behaviors without knowing the transition probabilities or reward functions.

## Q-Learning Algorithm

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that directly approximates the optimal Q-function without requiring knowledge of the transition probabilities or reward functions. It is an off-policy algorithm, meaning it can learn from actions that are outside the current policy being evaluated.

### Numerical Scheme for solving the Bellman Equation

The Q-learning algorithm uses an iterative approach to solve the Q-Bellman equation. The numerical scheme is as follows:

1. Initialize the Q-function arbitrarily for all state-action pairs:

   <div class="math">
   $$
   \underbrace{Q_0(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Initial Q-values} \\ \text{for all state-action pairs}}} \text{ for all } i \in S, u \in A(i)
   $$
   </div>

   A common initialization is to set all Q-values to zero or to small random values.

2. For each iteration $m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$, update the Q-function using the following rule:

   <div class="math">
   $$
   \underbrace{Q_{m+1}(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Updated Q-value} \\ \text{at iteration } m+1}} = \sum_{j=1}^n \underbrace{p_{ij}(u)}_{\substack{\text{Transition} \\ \text{probability}}} \left( \underbrace{g(i,u,j)}_{\substack{\text{Immediate} \\ \text{cost}}} + \underbrace{\min_{v \in A(j)} Q_m(j,v)}_{\substack{\text{Minimum Q-value} \\ \text{for next state}}} \right)
   $$
   </div>

   This update rule directly implements the Q-Bellman equation (4) in an iterative manner.

3. Repeat step 2 until convergence, i.e., until the maximum change in any Q-value is below a specified threshold:

   <div class="math">
   $$
   \underbrace{\max_{i \in S, u \in A(i)} |Q_{m+1}(i,u) - Q_m(i,u)|}_{\substack{\text{Maximum change in Q-values} \\ \text{between iterations}}} < \underbrace{\epsilon}_{\substack{\text{Convergence} \\ \text{threshold}}}
   $$
   </div>

It can be mathematically proven that this iterative process converges to the optimal Q-function:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{\lim_{m \to \infty} Q_m(i,u) = Q^*(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Convergence to optimal Q-values} \\ \text{as number of iterations approaches infinity}}} \quad \forall i \in S, u \in A(i)
$$
</div>

The convergence is guaranteed under the following conditions:

- The state and action spaces are finite
- Every state-action pair is visited infinitely often
- The learning rate (if used in stochastic updates) satisfies the Robbins-Monro conditions

Once the Q-function has converged, the optimal policy can be extracted by selecting the action with the minimum Q-value in each state:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{\mu^*(i) = \arg\min_{u \in A(i)} Q^*(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Optimal policy derived} \\ \text{from optimal Q-values}}}
$$
</div>

## The problem

However in model-free reinforcement learning, we do not have access to the transition probabilities or reward functions. Therefore, we need to estimate the Q-function from experience.

## The Q-Learning Algorithm

The Q-Learning update rule is:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{Q_{m+1}(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Updated Q-value} \\ \text{at iteration } m+1}} = \underbrace{Q_m(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value} \\ \text{estimate}}} + \underbrace{\gamma_m}_{\substack{\text{Learning} \\ \text{rate}}} \left( \underbrace{g(i,u,j)}_{\substack{\text{Observed} \\ \text{immediate cost}}} + \underbrace{\min_{v \in A(j)} Q_m(j,v)}_{\substack{\text{Estimated minimum Q-value} \\ \text{for next state}}} - \underbrace{Q_m(i,u)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value} \\ \text{estimate}}} \right)
$$
</div>

where:

- $Q_m(i,u)$ is the current Q-value estimate for state $i$ and action $u$
- $\gamma_m$ is the learning rate such that $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \gamma_m = \infty$ and $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \gamma_m^2 < \infty$
- $g(i,u,j)$ is the observed immediate cost when taking action $u$ in state $i$ and transitioning to state $j$
- $\min_{v \in A(j)} Q_m(j,v)$ is the estimated minimum Q-value for the next state $j$

This update is performed for all state-action pairs $(i,u)$ that are visited during learning.

### Learning Rate Requirements

The learning rate $\gamma_m$ should be selected to satisfy the Robbins-Monro conditions:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \gamma_m = \infty}_{\substack{\text{Learning rates should} \\ \text{sum to infinity}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \underbrace{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \gamma_m^2 < \infty}_{\substack{\text{Sum of squared learning} \\ \text{rates should be finite}}}
$$
</div>

These conditions ensure that:

1. The learning process can overcome any initial estimation errors (first condition)
2. The estimates eventually converge and don't oscillate indefinitely (second condition)

Common choices for the learning rate include:

- $\gamma_m = \frac{1}{1+\text{visits}(i,u)}$ where visits$(i,u)$ counts how many times the state-action pair has been visited
- $\gamma_m = \frac{c}{c+m}$ where $c$ is a constant and $m$ is the iteration number

## Online setting for Q-learning

In the online setting for Q-learning, we update the Q-values as we interact with the environment in real-time. The process works as follows:

Suppose state $s_t$ is visited at time $t$. The online Q-learning update rule is:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Updated Q-value} \\ \text{at time } t+1}} = \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} + \underbrace{\gamma_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Learning rate}}} \left( \underbrace{g(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Observed} \\ \text{immediate cost}}} + \underbrace{\min_{u \in A(s_{t+1})} Q_t(s_{t+1},u)}_{\substack{\text{Estimated minimum Q-value} \\ \text{for next state}}} - \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} \right)
$$
</div>

with:

<div class="math">
$$
Q_{t+1}(s,a) = Q_t(s,a) \quad \forall s \neq s_t \text{ or } a \neq a_t
$$
</div>

## Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff and ε-greedy policy

When we are at state $s_t$, which action should we take?

We cannot just take the action with minimum Q-value - we have to do exploration. A common approach is:

- We select $a_t$ randomly from the set $A(s_t)$ with some exploration probability
- Then update the value of Q-value for the state-action pair

An alternative way of rewriting the Q-learning update is:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Updated Q-value} \\ \text{at time } t+1}} = \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} + \underbrace{\gamma_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Learning rate}}} \left( \underbrace{g(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Observed} \\ \text{immediate cost}}} + \underbrace{Q_t(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Q-value for} \\ \text{next state-action}}} - \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} \right)
$$
</div>

For action selection, a common strategy is the ε-greedy approach:

<div class="math">
$$
a_t = \begin{cases}
\underbrace{\arg\min_{u \in A(s_t)} Q_t(s_t,u)}_{\substack{\text{Exploitation:} \\ \text{Choose best action}}} & \text{with probability } 1-\varepsilon \\
\underbrace{\text{random action from } A(s_t)}_{\substack{\text{Exploration:} \\ \text{Try new actions}}} & \text{with probability } \varepsilon
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

For the next state, we typically choose:

<div class="math">
$$
a_{t+1} = \underbrace{\arg\min_{u \in A(s_{t+1})} Q_t(s_{t+1},u)}_{\substack{\text{Best action according} \\ \text{to current Q-values}}}
$$
</div>

This exploration-exploitation tradeoff is crucial for effective Q-learning.

## SARSA: On-Policy TD Control

SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy temporal difference control algorithm for reinforcement learning. Unlike Q-learning, which is an off-policy method, SARSA learns the Q-values based on the actions actually taken by the current policy.

### Algorithm Overview

The name "SARSA" comes from the quintuple $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ that makes up the core of the algorithm. The key difference from Q-learning is that SARSA uses the actual next action $a_{t+1}$ that is chosen according to the current policy, rather than the theoretical best action.

### SARSA Update Rule

The update rule for SARSA is:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Updated Q-value} \\ \text{at time } t+1}} = \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} + \underbrace{\gamma_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Learning rate}}} \left( \underbrace{g(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Observed} \\ \text{immediate cost}}} + \underbrace{Q_t(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Q-value for actual} \\ \text{next state-action pair}}} - \underbrace{Q_t(s_t,a_t)}_{\substack{\text{Current Q-value}}} \right)
$$
</div>

### Action Selection in SARSA

For SARSA, both the current action $a_t$ and the next action $a_{t+1}$ are selected using the same policy, typically ε-greedy:

<div class="math">
$$
a_t = \begin{cases}
\underbrace{\arg\min_{u \in A(s_t)} Q_t(s_t,u)}_{\substack{\text{Exploitation:} \\ \text{Choose best action}}} & \text{with probability } 1-\varepsilon \\
\underbrace{\text{random action from } A(s_t)}_{\substack{\text{Exploration:} \\ \text{Try new actions}}} & \text{with probability } \varepsilon
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

Similarly for the next action:

<div class="math">
$$
a_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
\underbrace{\arg\min_{u \in A(s_{t+1})} Q_t(s_{t+1},u)}_{\substack{\text{Exploitation:} \\ \text{Choose best action}}} & \text{with probability } 1-\varepsilon \\
\underbrace{\text{random action from } A(s_{t+1})}_{\substack{\text{Exploration:} \\ \text{Try new actions}}} & \text{with probability } \varepsilon
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

### SARSA as an On-Policy Algorithm

SARSA is considered an on-policy algorithm because it learns Q-values based on the actual behavior of the policy being followed, including its exploratory moves. This makes SARSA more conservative than Q-learning in some scenarios, as it takes into account the risk associated with exploration.

### Extensions of SARSA

There are several extensions to the basic SARSA algorithm:

- **Double SARSA**: Similar to Double Q-learning, it maintains two sets of Q-values to reduce overestimation bias
- **Expected SARSA**: Instead of using the Q-value of the actual next action, it uses the expected Q-value under the current policy
- **n-step SARSA**: Extends the update to consider n steps ahead rather than just the immediate next step
