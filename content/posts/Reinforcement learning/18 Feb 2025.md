## Proposition: Optimality Conditions in Policy Iteration

Let's examine a fundamental proposition that establishes optimality conditions for policy iteration in infinite horizon discounted cost problems. This proposition provides crucial insights into why policy iteration converges to optimal policies.

### Statement of the Proposition

Consider a stationary policy $\bar{\mu}$ that satisfies the Bellman optimality condition:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{T_{\bar{\mu}}J^{\bar{\mu}} = TJ^{\bar{\mu}}}_{\substack{\text{Policy } \bar{\mu} \text{ achieves the minimum} \\ \text{in the Bellman equation for all states}}}
$$
</div>

This can be expressed more explicitly for all states $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$ as:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{g(i,\bar{\mu}(i)) + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^n p_{ij}(\bar{\mu}(i))J^{\bar{\mu}}(j)}_{\substack{\text{Expected discounted cost} \\ \text{following policy } \bar{\mu} \text{ from state } i}} = \underbrace{\min_{u \in A(i)} \left[g(i,u) + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^n p_{ij}(u)J^{\bar{\mu}}(j)\right]}_{\substack{\text{Minimum expected discounted cost} \\ \text{over all possible actions in state } i}}
$$
</div>

### Key Properties

The proposition establishes two fundamental properties:

1. **Global Policy Dominance**:
   For all states $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$ and any alternative policy $\mu$:

   <div class="math">
   $$
   \underbrace{J_{\bar{\mu}}(i) \leq J_{\mu}(i)}_{\substack{\text{Policy } \bar{\mu} \text{ achieves lower or equal cost} \\ \text{compared to any other policy } \mu \text{ at every state}}}
   $$
   </div>

2. **Strict Improvement Condition**:
   If $\bar{\mu}$ is not optimal, then there exists at least one state $s$ where:

   <div class="math">
   $$
   \underbrace{J_{\bar{\mu}}(s) < J_{\mu}(s)}_{\substack{\text{Strict cost improvement exists} \\ \text{at state } s \text{ for some better policy}}}
   $$
   </div>

### Implications and Significance

This proposition has several important implications:

- **Optimality Verification**: A policy satisfying the Bellman equation is guaranteed to be at least as good as any other policy across all states
- **Improvement Guarantee**: Non-optimal policies must have room for improvement in at least one state
- **Convergence Foundation**: These properties ensure that policy iteration will continue improving until reaching an optimal policy
- **Termination Condition**: When no further improvements are possible, we have reached global optimality

This theoretical foundation explains why policy iteration is a powerful algorithm for finding optimal policies in infinite horizon discounted cost problems.

## Policy Iteration Algorithm

The policy iteration algorithm consists of three main steps that are repeated until convergence:

### Step 1: Policy Initialization

Initialize with any stationary policy $\mu^0$:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{\mu^0: S \to A}_{\substack{\text{Initial mapping from} \\ \text{states to actions}}}
$$
</div>

### Step 2: Policy Evaluation

Given a stationary policy $\mu^k$, compute the corresponding cost $J^{\mu^k}$ by solving the linear system:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{(I - \alpha P_{\mu^k})J^{\mu^k} = g_{\mu^k}}_{\substack{\text{System of linear equations} \\ \text{for policy evaluation}}}
$$
</div>

Which can be equivalently written as:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{J^{\mu^k} = g_{\mu^k} + \alpha P_{\mu^k}J^{\mu^k}}_{\substack{\text{Fixed point equation} \\ \text{for policy evaluation}}}
$$
</div>

Or in operator notation:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{J^{\mu^k} = T_{\mu^k}J^{\mu^k}}_{\substack{\text{Policy evaluation as} \\ \text{a fixed point}}}
$$
</div>

### Step 3: Policy Improvement

Obtain a new stationary policy $\mu^{k+1}$ satisfying:

<div class="math">
$$
\underbrace{T_{\mu^{k+1}}J^{\mu^k} = TJ^{\mu^k}}_{\substack{\text{New policy achieves the minimum} \\ \text{in the Bellman equation}}}
$$
</div>

### Termination Check

- If $J^{\mu^{k+1}} = J^{\mu^k}$: then the current policy $\mu^k$ is optimal and the algorithm terminates.
- Else: Set $k = k + 1$ and return to Step 2

Note that both $g_{\mu^k}$ and $P_{\mu^k}$ are computed using the current policy $\mu^k$ as follows:

- For the cost vector $g_{\mu^k}$:

<div class="math">
$$
g_{\mu^k} = \begin{bmatrix} 
g(1,\mu^k(1)) \\
g(2,\mu^k(2)) \\
\vdots \\
g(n,\mu^k(n))
\end{bmatrix}_{n \times 1}
$$
</div>

- For the probability transition matrix $P_{\mu^k}$:

<div class="math">
$$
P_{\mu^k} = \begin{bmatrix}
p(1,\mu^k(1),1) & p(1,\mu^k(1),2) & \cdots & p(1,\mu^k(1),n) \\
p(2,\mu^k(2),1) & p(2,\mu^k(2),2) & \cdots & p(2,\mu^k(2),n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
p(n,\mu^k(n),1) & p(n,\mu^k(n),2) & \cdots & p(n,\mu^k(n),n)
\end{bmatrix}_{n \times n}
$$
</div>

where $n$ is the total number of states in the system.

This algorithm systematically improves the policy until reaching optimality, with each iteration guaranteed to either:

- Strictly improve the policy, or
- Confirm the current policy is optimal

The convergence is finite since:

- There are only finitely many deterministic stationary policies
- Each iteration either improves or terminates
- The algorithm cannot revisit a previous policy
