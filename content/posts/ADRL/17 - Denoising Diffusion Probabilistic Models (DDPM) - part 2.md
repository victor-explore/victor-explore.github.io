We were using latent variables $X_t$ to model the data as:

$$\log p_\theta(x_0) = \log \int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T}$$ 

This formulation expresses the log-likelihood of the observed data $x_0$ as an integral over all possible latent variable sequences $x_{1:T}$. The model's goal is to maximize this log-likelihood, which involves learning the parameters $\theta$ that define the generative process from $x_T$ back to $x_0$.

Also:
- $p_\theta(x_T) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ - The prior distribution of the final latent variable is a standard normal distribution
- $p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = p_\theta(x_T) \prod_{t=1}^T p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ - The joint distribution of all latent variables is factorized using the chain rule
- $q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)I)$ - The forward process transition probability is a Gaussian distribution
- $q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ - The posterior of all latent variables given the data is factorized using the chain rule

Because the log likelihood is intractable, we constructed the ELBO of the model:
<div class="math-katex">
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{0:T|x_0})} \bigg[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T|x_0})}\bigg]$$
</div>
We did algebraic manipulations to decompose ELBO into three terms: reconstruction, prior matching, and transition matching terms.
<div class="math-katex">
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} \left[\log p_\theta(x_0|x_1) + \log \frac{p_\theta(x_T)}{q(x_T|x_0)} + \sum_{t=2}^T \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)}\right]$$ 
</div>

## Reconstruction term
The reconstruction term is given by:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_1 = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} \log p_\theta(x_0|x_1)$$
</div>
Since this term inside the expectation only depends on $x_1$ when predicting $x_0$, we can simplify it to $\mathbb{E}_{q(x_1|x_0)}$
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_1 = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_1|x_0)} \log p_\theta(x_0|x_1)$$
</div>
This step demonstrates that the reconstruction term only depends on $x_0$ and $x_1$, regardless of the other latent variables.

Recall that the forward process is defined as:

$$x_1 = \sqrt{\alpha_1} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\alpha_1} \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$$

To reconstruct $x_0$ from $x_1$ (the first latent sample), we assume a Gaussian distribution:

$$p_\theta(x_0|x_1) = \mathcal{N}(x_0; \mu_\theta(x_1, 1), \sigma_1^2 I)$$

Where:
- $\mu_\theta(x_1, 1)$ is the mean predicted by the model
- $\sigma_1^2$ is a fixed variance (usually set to $\beta_1 = 1 - \alpha_1$)

With this Gaussian assumption, the reconstruction term becomes:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_1 \approx -\frac{1}{2\sigma_1^2} \mathbb{E}_{q(x_1|x_0)} \|\mu_\theta(x_1, 1) - x_0\|^2 + C$$
</div>
Where C is a constant independent of $\theta$

## Prior matching term

The prior matching term is given by:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_2 = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} \left[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_T)}{q(x_T|x_0)}\right]$$
</div>

Because the term inside the expectation is independent of $x_{2:T}$, we can simplify it to $\mathbb{E}_{q(x_T |x_0)}$
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_2 = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_T|x_0)} \left[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_T)}{q(x_T|x_0)}\right]$$
</div>
This term can be simplified as:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_2 = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_T|x_0)} \left[\log p_\theta(x_T) - \log q(x_T|x_0)\right]$$
</div>

$$T_2 = - D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) \| p_\theta(x_T))$$



Note that $T_2$ can be ignored during optimization because:
1. It doesn't depend on the model parameters $\theta$
2. $p_\theta(x_T) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ is fixed

This prior matching term is similar to the KL divergence term in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), $D_{KL}(q(z|x) \| p(z))$, where it encourages the approximate posterior to match the prior distribution.
 
## Transition matching/ Consistency/ Denoising matching term

The transition matching term is given by:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_3 = \sum_{t=2}^T \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} \left[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)}\right]$$
</div>
Since the term inside the expectation $\mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}$ is independent of $x_{2:T}$, we can simplify it to $\mathbb{E}_{q(x_t, x_{t-1}|x_0)}$
$$T_3 = \sum_{t=2}^T \mathbb{E}_{q(x_t, x_{t-1}|x_0)} \left[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)}\right]$$

It can be shown that: 
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_3 = - \sum_{t=2}^T \mathbb{E}_{q(x_t|x_0)} [D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) \| p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))]$$
</div>


Consider the first term in the KL divergence. By applying Bayes' law, we can rewrite it as:

$$q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = q(x_t|x_{t-1},x_0) \frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)}$$

$$q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = \frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1})q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)}$$

We know that:

- $q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)I)$
- $q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_t)I)$ where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i$ - Skipped derivation but it is in class notes
- $q(x_{t-1}|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1})I)$

Substituting these into the equation for $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)$, we get(Derivation skipped but it is eqn 84 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11970 ):
<div class="math-katex">
$$q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = \frac{\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)I) \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1})I)}{\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_t)I)}$$
</div>
This can be simplified to:

$$q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_q(x_t,x_0), \Sigma_q(t))$$

Where:
<div class="math-katex">
$$\mu_q(x_t,x_0) = \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t}(1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1})x_t + \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}(1-\alpha_t)x_0}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}$$
</div>
$$\Sigma_q(t) = \frac{(1-\alpha_t)(1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}I$$


Now, let's consider the second term in the KL divergence, $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$. In DDPM, this is modeled as a Gaussian distribution:

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t))$$

The KL divergence between two Gaussian distributions has a closed-form expression. Therefore, we can compute $T_3$ analytically:
<div class="math-katex">
$$T_3 = - \sum_{t=2}^T \mathbb{E}_{q(x_t|x_0)} \left[\frac{1}{2} \left(\log \frac{|\Sigma_\theta|}{|\Sigma_q|} - d + tr(\Sigma_\theta^{-1}\Sigma_q) + (\mu_q-\mu_\theta)^T \Sigma_\theta^{-1} (\mu_q-\mu_\theta)\right)\right]$$
</div>

Here, $d$ is the dimensionality of the data, and $tr$ denotes the trace of a matrix.

This term encourages the learned reverse process $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ to match the true posterior $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)$, which is why it's called the transition matching or consistency term.
