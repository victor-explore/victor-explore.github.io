- This is not the review of the course, it is just the takeaways and notes that i made while watching the course.

## My notes
- Write the ideas that come to your mind when going to the gym, listening to a podcast, reading a book, etc. It should not just be the ideas, but also how you will make a visual representation of the idea.
