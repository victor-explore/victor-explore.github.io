## Details
- Cource link - https://www.udemy.com/course/single-family-home-rental-property-analysis-course/
- This is not the review of the course, it is just the takeaways and notes that i made while watching the course.

## My notes
- Have brokers send deals to you, this should happen on a daily basis - you should be flooded with deals.
- Have an excel sheet or software to track screen the deals.
- Should have a management teams option to manage the property.
- Chotu/mother/brother relation to check on the property managers.
- Do check migration patterns using government data.
- How many properties does the property manager manage? - It should not be that a small property manager is managing 1000 properties and is not able to give attention to the property.
- You should also have a general contractor that you can trust.
- There are free resources to check how the rents have been changing in the area.
- Use competing properties to check what the rents are in the area.
- Use website to check how the rent has been changing in the area  -use that data to feed in out model
- Do chek if there is vacancy rate available on the internet
- Also use internet to enter the historical property appreciation data.
- Should i take adjustable emi? 

## From youtube
- Carpet area - area inside the external walls. Do not compare 2 bhk to 2 bhk do consider the carpet area
- Encumbrance certificate - check if there are any disputes on the property.Example - bank loan, tax, tenant
- Chain of title for previous owners for say last 50 years
- website to check property value - 99acres, magicbricks, makaan, housing.com, commonfloor, indiaproperty.com
- Skeptical if being sold using general power of attorney
