# AI Learning Roadmap

I have made this roadmap that I will give to my younger brother who is starting his learning journey in AI. The key points of this roadmap are:

- The roadmap assumes you have basic knowledge of maths and programming of a 12th class pass out.
- All the resources are free.
- The roadmap is linear, follow it step by step. However, if you have a good grasp of a topic, you can skip it and move to the immediate next topic.
- The roadmap is not exhaustive, I have designed it so that you learn 90% of the most important topics in AI.
- I have seen most AI learning resources to either focus on maths or programming. I have designed this roadmap to cover both.
- This is not the only possible roadmap, there are many other roadmaps that are possible. This is just a roadmap that I think is best for a beginner learning on his own.
- There are thousands of students from all walks of life studying this roadmap in this [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme) server
- I have made the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme) server for students who are following this roadmap to help them learn and grow together. Here is the link to the server: [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme). Do join thousands of students who would be learning along with you.
- I also encourage you to learn about the topics from other sources as well in addition to the ones mentioned in the roadmap if you have more time.
- In case you are not able to understand a particular topic from the resources mentioned in the roadmap, do explore other resources and share your experience.
- As and when I find a better new resource, I will update the roadmap. If you have any suggestions, please let me know so that I can update the roadmap.
- This roadmap is up to date. As and when an important breakthrough comes in the field of AI, that is important, I will update the roadmap.

## After completing the roadmap:

- You should pick one or more area of expertise like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc. and start applying your knowledge and learning advance topics in that domain.
- There is no use of learning AI if you are not applying your knowledge. You should start working on real world projects. Either start working on your own projects or contribute to the projects at your company/open source community.
- AI is one of the fastest growing field, so do keep yourself updated with the latest research, news and products.

## My tips for the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme) server:

- The [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme) server is free and open to all with a learning mindset. Do invite your friends and classmates by sharing the server link on your social media handles and bring them along on this learning journey so that you can learn and grow together. Moreover the more members in the server, the more easier it will be to get help from each other and more resources will be shared for everyone's benefit.
- Do not hesitate to ask questions. Moreover, if you have time do help others by answering their questions as this will help you solidify your understanding of the topic.
- Do find friends in this [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QHAbprqQme) server who are learning along with you and do form a study group(if possible find friends that you can even meet in person).

## Here is the roadmap:

### 1. Maths prerequisites

#### 1.1 Linear Algebra

- [Linear Algebra by Imperial College London](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiiljHvN6z1_o1ztXTKWPrShrMrBLo5P3)
- [3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

#### 1.2 Calculus and Optimization

- [Multivariate Calculus by Imperial College London](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiiljHvN6z193BBzS0Ln8NnqQmzimTW23)

#### 1.3 Probability

- [Probability Theory from The Bright Side of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2qswFOC98oSFc37-0f4S3D4z)

### 2. Coding

- [Python for Beginners by Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) (Skip if you already know basics of Python)
- [Learn Git from Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) (Skip if you already know Git)
- [Learn to make virtual environment in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxvKCSwlUv8)
- [Pytorch beginner series by PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_lsbAsL_o2CTlGHgMxNrKhzP97BaG9ZN) (Do not try to understand everything about PyTorch at once, just get some idea then learn more about it as you code AI models from Machine Learning and Deep Learning section)

### 3. Machine Learning

- [Machine Learning by Josh Starmer from StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)
- Do implement all the basic machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc. that are taught in the playlist in PyTorch. Youtube has a lot of tutorials on how to implement these models in PyTorch.

### 4. Deep Learning

- [Deep Learning by Josh Starmer from StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1)
- [Neural networks from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- Implement all the models learned in the playlists in PyTorch. You can follow [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4)
- Become proficient in coding Deep Learning models by following [Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)

Finally I will again emphasize that this is not the end of the learning journey, rather it is the beginning. I have designed this roadmap so that you learn 90% of the most important topics in AI which will act as a foundation for your further learning a particular subdomain of AI.

I have also kept it easy so that everyone with a basic knowledge of maths + programming and a learning mindset can learn AI on their own. Each of the topics in the roadmap can also be taught very rigorously in a much more academic setting in a university.

Lastly, I have not made this roadmap for someone learning AI for some particular entrance exam like GATE etc. I have made this roadmap that I feel is best for someone who is learning AI own his own, use this as foundation to deep dive into a particular subdomain of AI and make real world impact.
