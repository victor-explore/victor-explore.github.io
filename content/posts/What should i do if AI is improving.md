# Given that
- Seems that AI is improving at a rapid pace


# Following jobs will be lost
- Text to video models etc will replace Actors, producers, writers etc.
- Text to speech models will replace Singers
- AI pimps will replace Only fans, Ticktok creators etc
- Tools like Claude computer use will replace all remote workers
- Indie hackers relying on microsaas will be replaced by AI. Infact most SaaS will be replaced by AI.
- Bloggers and most sites will be replaced by SearchGPTs.
- All consultants like lawyers who do not go to court, accountants etc.
- I cannot find a job where you do 9 to 5 on a computer and you not getting replaced by AI.
- 99% of all book authors except for people like Marcus Aurelius will be replaced by AI.
- Online courses, teachers even nice people like Khan Academy will be replaced by AI. Heck i do not think that even great colleges like IISC and IITs teaching computer science will be spared.
- Copywriters
-  Affiliate marketers because of tools like perplexity shopping

# If we are able to build robots
- If we are able to get robots which also seems likely then even jobs that require physical actions will also be replaced by AI.

# How to prepare for this brave new world
- Invest all your money to buy AI tools and tech upgrades.
- Be a super learner.
- Obviously it will become easier to make a software/videos/agents etc in the future but you still have to push the current tools to absolute limits - so that you are prepared for the future when these tools mature.

# These effors will not be in vain
- Building an audience on X.
- Keeping up with AI progress. Learning about AI.
- Evergreen phylosophy etc
- Spending time with family and friends.
- I building AI agents will be the only thing that matters if there was one thing that mattered.


# What i think will still be valuable
- Bitcoin, Ethereum maybe
- Land
- I will not bet that thousand year old trend of gold being valueable will be replaced.

# I feel that somehow these jobs will still be there
- Sports
- I would have written artists, actors etc but most of them are crooks in real life. We do not watch them because we are inspired by them in real life.

# Contarary to popular belief
- I think AI will be able to empatize even better than humans.

# These are the things that excite me
- AR glasses with a personal coach/secretary.
- GPT 5/6 level AI agents.
