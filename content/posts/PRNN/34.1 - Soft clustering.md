## Problem Setup

Data: Let the dataset be $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}$, where each data point $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The data points are unlabeled.

Latent Variable: Let $z \in \{1, ..., m\}$ be a latent variable representing the clusters, where $m$ is the total number of clusters. 

We can extend the dataset as $D = \{(x_i, z_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where each data point $x_i$ is associated with its (unknown) cluster $z_i$.

## Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

The GMM defines the probability of observing a data point $x$ as:

$p_\theta(x) = \sum_{j=1}^m p_\theta(x|z=j) p_\theta(z=j) = \sum_{j=1}^m N(x; \mu_j, \Sigma_j) \pi_j$

Where:
- $N(x; \mu_j, \Sigma_j)$ is the Gaussian probability density function for cluster $j$, with mean $\mu_j$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_j$.
- $\pi_j$ is the probability of a data point belonging to cluster $j$.

### Model Parameters

The set of parameters $\theta$ that we need to estimate consists of:
$$\theta = \{\mu_1, ..., \mu_m, \Sigma_1, ..., \Sigma_m, \pi_1, ..., \pi_m\}$$

## Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm

We use the EM algorithm to get ideal parameters $\theta^* = \{\mu^*, \Sigma^*, \pi^*\}$.

## Soft Clustering

Use the parameters $\theta^* = \{\mu^*, \Sigma^*, \pi^*\}$ to get the soft clustering:
<div class="math-katex">
$$p_{\theta^*}(z=z_i|x=x_i) = \frac{p_{\theta^*}(x_i|z_i) p_{\theta^*}(z_i)}{\sum_z p_{\theta^*}(x_i|z) p_{\theta^*}(z)}$$
</div>
<div class="math-katex">
$$p_{\theta^*}(z=z_i|x=x_i) = \frac{N(x_i; \mu^*_{z_i}, \Sigma^*_{z_i}) \pi^*_i}{\sum_j N(x_i; \mu^*_j, \Sigma^*_j) \pi^*_j}$$
</div>
$$p_{\theta^*}(z=z_i|x=x_i) = \frac{N(x_i; \mu^*_{z_i}, \Sigma^*_{z_i}) \pi^*_i}{\sum_j N(x_i; \mu^*_j, \Sigma^*_j) \pi^*_j}$$

This is a discrete distribution over the $m$ clusters.

### Some more uses of soft clustering

This soft clustering can also be used for embedding or dimensionality reduction:
1. Compute the probability distribution for each data point over the $m$ clusters.
2. Use these probabilities as an $m$-dimensional embedding for each data point.
3. This new representation captures the data's structure in a lower-dimensional space.
