In XGBoost, the weak learners are decision trees.

The algorithm builds these trees sequentially, with each new tree aiming to correct the errors of the combined previous trees.

1. Recall that $r_i = -\frac{\partial R(H_{T-1}(x_i))}{\partial H_{T-1}(x_i)}$ are the pseudo-residuals.

2. XGBoost formulates the optimization problem for finding the next weak learner as:

   $$ h_T = \arg\min_{h \in H} \sum_{i=1}^n (r_i \cdot h(x_i) + \frac{1}{2} h(x_i)^2) $$

3. We can rewrite this by defining $\hat{y}_i = -r_i$:

   $$ h_T = \arg\min_{h \in H} \sum_{i=1}^n (-\hat{y}_i \cdot h(x_i) + \frac{1}{2} h(x_i)^2) $$

   where $\hat{y}_i = \frac{\partial R(H_{T-1}(x_i))}{\partial H_{T-1}(x_i)}$

4. This formulation is equivalent to:
<div class="math-katex">
   $$ h_T = \arg\min_{h \in H} \sum_{i=1}^n (h(x_i) - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$
</div>
   which is the standard squared error regression problem with new labels $\hat{y}_i$.

5. In practice, $\hat{y}_i$ is approximated as:
<div class="math-katex">
   $$ \hat{y}_i = H_{T-1}(x_i) - y_i $$
</div>
   where $y_i$ is the true label and $H_{T-1}(x_i)$ is the prediction of the ensemble up to the previous iteration. This approximation is derived from the first-order Taylor expansion of the gradient when using the squared error loss $L(y_i, H(x_i)) = \frac{1}{2}(y_i - H(x_i))^2$.

## Algorithm
The XGBoost algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Initialize the model with a constant value:
   $$ H_0(x) = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, \gamma) $$

2. For t = 1 to T (number of trees):
   
   a. Update labels:
   <div class="math-katex">
      $$ \hat{y}_i = H_{T-1}(x_i) - y_i $$
      for $i = 1, ..., n$
   </div>
   b. Fit a regression tree to the updated labels, giving terminal regions $R_j^t$, $j = 1, ..., J_t$

   c. For each terminal region $R_j^t$, compute:
      $$ \gamma_{jt} = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{x_i \in R_{jt}} L(y_i, H_{t-1}(x_i) + \gamma) $$
   This step computes the optimal value $γ_jt$ (the adjustment) for each leaf region $R_j^t$, minimizing the loss function $L$ for observations in that region. This "boost" is added to the current model predictions in the next step.

   d. Update the model:
      $$ H_t(x) = H_{t-1}(x) + \nu \sum_{j=1}^{J_t} \gamma_{jt} I(x \in R_{jt}) $$
      where $\nu$ is the learning rate (0 < $\nu$ ≤ 1) that controls how much of the new tree's contribution is added to the current model, $\gamma_{jt}$ is the prediction adjustment for each terminal region $R_{jt}$ of the tree, and $I(x \in R_{jt})$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if $x$ belongs to region $R_{jt}$ and 0 otherwise.

3. Output the final model:
   $$ H(x) = H_T(x) = \sum_{t=0}^T \nu \sum_{j=1}^{J_t} \gamma_{jt} I(x \in R_{jt}) $$
   The final model is the sum of all the contributions from the individual trees, with each tree's contribution scaled by the learning rate $\nu$.
